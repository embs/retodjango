### Setup

With Docker: see [docker facilities][docker].

#### Without Docker

    $ npm install

It is also needed to start [tutor][tutor] and [slate][slate].  See their READMEs
for instructions on how to do it.

Additionally, you'll need to provide a chromedriver running on localhost:9515.

### Run

Without Docker:

    $ npm test

[docker]: ../docker/README.md
[tutor]: ../tutor/README.md
[slate]: ../slate/README.md
